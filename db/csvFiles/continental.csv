California to Maine: Perfect Your Weekend," Few outdoor institutions are more sacred—and fragile—than the weekend trip.

Best Adventure Islands: Molokai,"It's not all cheap muumuus and mai tais here on the second smallest island in the Hawaiian chain, and that suits the few travelers who make the hour-and-a-half ferry crossing from Maui or the 20-minute flight from Oahu just fine.

Just one thing: To sample Molokai's delights, visitors need to roll up their shirtsleeves—exploration on this island requires more than flip-flops and shades.

Fly-fish in Utopia,"When the mexican government offered to pave the sand streets of Isla Holbox, the 1,600 or so residents of this dagger-shaped cay, just off the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula, said 'gracias, pero no.' That's the kind of independent spirit that pervades this easygoing, little-visited outpost—a well-guarded enclave of fishermen, divers, and seriously tan Italian expats who have an aversion to wearing shoes.To get here, make the 30-minute ferry crossing from Chiquilá on the mainland, then drop your bags at the just opened Isla Holbox Flyfishing Lodge, a five-room wooden guesthouse directly on the beach.
